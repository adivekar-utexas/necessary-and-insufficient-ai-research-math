Deep learning is a field which has exploded in recent times with a lot of methods taking over  prior approaches to machine learning. We will not cover all of these methods (or even most of them)  simply because this book would be four times longer to even give a brief overview of  each method. We suggest interested readers cover  specific books on deep learning such as those by Bishop  or courses such as those on deeplearning.ai
